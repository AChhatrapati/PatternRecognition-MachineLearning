Project Name: Smart Energy Usage Prediction and Anomaly Detection

By: Avanigadda Chhatrapati | IIT Hyderabad | PRML

This project develops a comprehensive smart energy analytics system that predicts household power consumption and identifies anomalous usage patterns using Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (PRML) techniques. Bayesian MMSE/MMAE estimation is used for daily consumption prediction, Linear SVM for pattern classification, and likelihood based statistical methods for anomaly detection. Experimental results on a real-world energy dataset demonstrate high accuracy in prediction and detection tasks, establishing the relevance of PRML tools in modern smart energy management.
